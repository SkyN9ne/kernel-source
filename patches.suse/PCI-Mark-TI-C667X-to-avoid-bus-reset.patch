Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Mark TI C667X to avoid bus reset
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-transfer-encoding: 8bit
Git-commit: b5cf198e74a91073d12839a3e2db99994a39995d
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc7
References: git-fixes

Some TI KeyStone C667X devices do not support bus/hot reset.  The PCIESS
automatically disables LTSSM when Secondary Bus Reset is received and
device stops working.  Prevent bus reset for these devices.  With this
change, the device can be assigned to VMs with VFIO, but it will leak state
between VMs.
