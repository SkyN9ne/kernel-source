Subject: x86/mem_encrypt: Correct physical address calculation in
 __set_clr_pte_enc()
Git-commit: 8249d17d3194eac064a8ca5bc5ca0abc86feecde
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc5
References: 12sp5

The pfn variable contains the page frame number as returned by the
pXX_pfn() functions, shifted to the right by PAGE_SHIFT to remove the
page bits. After page protection computations are done to it, it gets
shifted back to the physical address using page_level_shift().

That is wrong, of course, because that function determines the shift
length based on the level of the page in the page table but in all the
cases, it was shifted by PAGE_SHIFT before.

Therefore, shift it back using PAGE_SHIFT to get the correct physical
address.
