Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix "Unexpected timeout" error in direct attach topology
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
Git-commit: e30d55137edef47434c40d7570276a0846fe922c
References: bsc#1186452

An 'unexpected timeout' message may be seen in a point-2-point topology.
The message occurs when a PLOGI is received before the driver is notified
of FLOGI completion. The FLOGI completion failure causes discovery to be
triggered for a second time. The discovery timer is restarted but no new
discovery activity is initiated, thus the timeout message eventually
appears.

In point-2-point, when discovery has progressed before the FLOGI completion
is processed, it is not a failure. Add code to FLOGI completion to detect
that discovery has progressed and exit the FLOGI handling (noop'ing it).
