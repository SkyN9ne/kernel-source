Subject: s390/dasd: fix list corruption of lcu list
Git-commit: 53a7f655834c7c335bf683f248208d4fbe4b47bc
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: bsc#1181170 LTC#190915

In dasd_alias_disconnect_device_from_lcu the device is removed from any
list on the LCU. Afterwards the LCU is removed from the lcu list if it
does not contain devices any longer.

The lcu->lock protects the lcu from parallel updates. But to cancel all
workers and wait for completion the lcu->lock has to be unlocked.

If two devices are removed in parallel and both are removed from the LCU
the first device that takes the lcu->lock again will delete the LCU because
it is already empty but the second device also tries to free the LCU which
leads to a list corruption of the lcu list.

Fix by removing the device right before the lcu is checked without
unlocking the lcu->lock in between.
