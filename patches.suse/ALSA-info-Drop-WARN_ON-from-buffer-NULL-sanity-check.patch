Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: info: Drop WARN_ON() from buffer NULL sanity check
Git-commit: 60379ba08532eca861e933b389526a4dc89e0c42
Patch-mainline: v5.8-rc7
References: git-fixes

snd_info_get_line() has a sanity check of NULL buffer -- both buffer
itself being NULL and buffer->buffer being NULL.  Basically both
checks are valid and necessary, but the problem is that it's with
snd_BUG_ON() macro that triggers WARN_ON().  The latter condition
(NULL buffer->buffer) can be met arbitrarily by user since the buffer
is allocated at the first write, so it means that user can trigger
WARN_ON() at will.

This patch addresses it by simply moving buffer->buffer NULL check out
of snd_BUG_ON() so that spurious WARNING is no longer triggered.
