Subject: cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add Icelake servers support in no-HWP mode
Patch-mainline: Submitted https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210518123413.20670-1-ggherdovich@suse.cz
References: bsc#1185758

Users may disable HWP in firmware, in which case intel_pstate wouldn't load
unless the CPU model is explicitly supported.

Add ICELAKE_X to the list of CPUs that can register intel_pstate while not
advertising the HWP capability. Without this change, an ICELAKE_X in no-HWP
mode could only use the acpi_cpufreq frequency scaling driver.

See also commit d8de7a44e11f ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add Skylake servers
support").
