Subject: [PATCH] gpio: max77620: Fixup debounce delays
Git-commit: b0391479ae04dfcbd208b9571c375064caad9a57
Patch-mainline: v5.4
References: git-fixes

When converting milliseconds to microseconds in commit fffa6af94894
("gpio: max77620: Use correct unit for debounce times") some ~1 ms gaps
were introduced between the various ranges supported by the controller.
Fix this by changing the start of each range to the value immediately
following the end of the previous range. This way a debounce time of,
say 8250 us will translate into 16 ms instead of returning an -EINVAL
error.

Typically the debounce delay is only ever set through device tree and
specified in milliseconds, so we can never really hit this issue because
debounce times are always a multiple of 1000 us.

The only notable exception for this is drivers/mmc/host/mmc-spi.c where
the CD GPIO is requested, which passes a 1 us debounce time. According
to a comment preceeding that code this should actually be 1 ms (i.e.
1000 us).
