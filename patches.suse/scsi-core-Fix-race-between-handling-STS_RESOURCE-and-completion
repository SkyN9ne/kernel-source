Subject: scsi: core: Fix race between handling STS_RESOURCE and completion
Git-commit: 673235f915318ced5d7ec4b2bfd8cb909e6a4a55
Patch-mainline: v5.10
References: bsc#1187883

When queuing I/O request to LLD, STS_RESOURCE may be returned because:

 - Host is in recovery or blocked

 - Target queue throttling or target is blocked

 - LLD rejection

In these scenarios BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE is returned to the block layer to
avoid an unnecessary re-run of the queue. However, all of the requests
queued to this SCSI device may complete immediately after reading
'sdev->device_busy' and BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE is returned to block layer. In
that case the current I/O won't get a chance to get queued since it is
invisible at that time for both scsi_run_queue_async() and blk-mq's
RESTART.

Fix the issue by not returning BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE in this situation.
